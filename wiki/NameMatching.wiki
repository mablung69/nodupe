= Introduction =

The best way to match two contacts is intersecate phone or mail, but 

*how to understand if two different names N, FN, NICKNAME refers to same person*?

There're some algorithms that can help, one above other [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Identification_and_Intelligence_System NYSIIS] which is still implemented in a python module.

I'm still testing a way to rank the matching of two names using different f(nysiis(n))  using a comparableCard class...

 = Cases = 
Here follows some data examples that we should try to match

{{{
N1: Obi Wan Kenobi
N2: Obi Wan
N3: Kenobi;Obi Wan


N4: obiwan.kenobi@resistence.org
N5: obiwankenobi@resistence.org
N6: obiwan@kenobi.org
}}}

N1-N3 are quite easy, it's about splitting and intersecting. We must be careful on single names (eg. given names only) that should be resolved manually.

N4-N6 needs some hinting and playing with nysiis.


 = Functions =
== set fraction ==

splitting both names by space we get two sets: {obi,wan,kenobi} and {obi,wan}
set_score =  #intersection / #union;  (ex #{obi,wan} / #{obi,wan,kenobi} )

== list fraction ==
same as set, but with list.
list_score = #intersection / avg(#set1, #set2) (ex. 2 / 2.5)
